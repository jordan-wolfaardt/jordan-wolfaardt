ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan Wolfaardt. I'm originally from Cape Town, South Africa and moved to the United States when I was nine.

ðŸ‘€ At work I use data and technology to make investment and portfolio management decisions. Outside of work, I love surfing, reading, and live music.

ðŸ’» Almost all the code I've written has been for work or school, neither of which am I able to post here. My favorite coding exercises are building simulations. I've used Python and C the most, but also have experience with C++, C#, Java, VBA, JavaScript, and Scala. I've worked with AWS extensively and Azure to a lesser extent.

ðŸŒ± I'm always learning! I have not yet found the bounds of my curiosity.

ðŸŽ¨ I cofounded a cloud-based data management company. We created a B2B application which we published to Microsoft's AppSource: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200003237
